    If you are using aklog, afslog, or some other program to obtain AFS
    tokens, give its path to configure with the `--with-aklog` option, as in:

    ```
        ./configure --with-aklog=/usr/local/bin/aklog
    ```

    This program will be run when the `-t` option is given to k5start or
    krenew.

    To enable support for AFS PAGs, pass the `--enable-setpag` flag to
    configure.  It is not enabled by default.  On platforms other than Linux
    and without the kafs library, you will need to add the `--with-afs` flag
    specifying the location of your AFS includes and libraries unless they're
    on your standard search path.  For example:

    ```
        ./configure --enable-setpag --with-afs=/usr/afsws
    ```

    When enabled, k5start and krenew will always create a new PAG before
    authentication when running a specific command and when aklog is being
    run.

    When using the Linux kafs module, the correct way to isolate kafs
    credentials is to create a new session keyring rather than a new PAG.
    This requires the libkeyutils library.  `configure` will attempt to
    discover that library automatically and link with it by default.  Pass the
    `--with-libkeyutils`, `--with-libkeyutils-include`, or
    `--with-libkeyutils-lib` options to `configure` to specify a different
    path to that library, or set the `LIBKEYUTILS_*` environment variables.

      summary: |
        A Debian package (named kstart) is available from Debian as of Debian
        4.0 (etch).  It includes k5start, and krenew built with setpag support
        and `/usr/bin/aklog` as the aklog path.

blurb: |
  k5start and krenew are modified versions of kinit which add support for
  running as a daemon to maintain a ticket cache, running a command with
  credentials from a keytab and maintaining a ticket cache until that command
  completes, obtaining AFS tokens (via an external aklog) after obtaining
  tickets, and creating an AFS PAG for a command.  They are primarily useful
  in conjunction with long-running jobs; for moving ticket handling code out
  of servers, cron jobs, or daemons; and to obtain tickets and AFS tokens with
  a single command.

description: |
  k5start is a modified version of kinit.  It can be used as a substitute for
  kinit (with some additional helpful options), but it can also obtain
  credentials automatically from a keytab.  It can run as a daemon, waking up
  periodically to refresh credentials using that keytab, and can also check
  for the validity of tickets and only refresh if they're no longer valid.

  Some of these capabilities have been included in Kerberos's kinit, but the
  ability to maintain tickets while running as a daemon has not and is useful
  for servers that need to use Kerberos.  Using kstart allows the ticket
  handling to be moved out of the server into a separate process dedicated
  just to that purpose.

  k5start can optionally run an external program whenever the ticket is
  refreshed to obtain an AFS token, and therefore can be used in conjunction
  with a program like aklog or afslog to maintain an AFS token.  When built
  with support for AFS PAGs, it can also put the program in its own PAG so
  that its authentication doesn't affect any other programs.

  krenew is identical to k5start except that rather than obtaining new tickets
  from a password or keytab, it renews an existing renewable ticket cache.  It
  can be used to periodically renew tickets and optionally AFS tokens for
  long-running processes in cases where using a keytab is inappropriate (such
  as users running their own jobs with their own credentials).

requirements: |
  As Kerberos programs, k5start and krenew require Kerberos libraries to link
  against.  They have only been thoroughly tested with the MIT Kerberos and
  Heimdal libraries on Debian, but should work with the included Kerberos
  libraries on many other platforms.

  Other than that, all you should need is a suitable C compiler.  Neither
  program has been tested on non-Unix systems.

  If you want the `-t` option to work, you need a program to obtain AFS tokens
  from Kerberos tickets.  You can specify the program to use on your system
  with the `--with-aklog` option to configure; if that option is not given,
  the first of aklog or afslog that is found on your path at configure time
  will be used.

  For AFS PAG support, one of Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris 11, the kafs library
  that comes with either Heimdal or KTH Kerberos, the kopenafs library that
  comes with newer OpenAFS, AFS header files (on any other platform besides
  AIX or IRIX), or AFS libraries (on AIX and IRIX) is required.  AIX binaries
  with AFS PAG support may not run on AIX systems that do not have an AFS
  client installed due to how AIX handles system calls.

test:
  lancaster: true
  prefix: |
    In order to test the client in a meaningful way, you will need to do some
    preparatory work before running the test suite.  Follow the instructions
    in `tests/data/README` first.  Then, you can run the test suite with:
  suffix: |
    Perl 5.008 or later and the kinit and klist programs from MIT Kerberos,
    not Heimdal, are required to run the test suite.  The following additional
    Perl modules will be used by the test suite if present:

    * Test::Pod
    * Test::Spelling

sections:
  - title: Thanks
    body: |
      To Navid Golpayegani, for contributing the initial implementation of the
      `-b` option to background after the initial authentication and the `-p`
      option to save the PID in a file.

      To Buck Huppmann, for contributing an RPM spec file and suggesting
      krenew.

      To Adam Megacz, for pointing out that checking the executability of the
      aklog program isn't necessary and for contributing the code to propagate
      signals to a child process.

      To Quanah Gibson-Mount, for pointing out various build system issues and
      missing documentation.

      To Sidney Cammeresi, for catching a missing include in krenew and for
      providing information and suggestions about Mac OS X's default ticket
      cache and its effects on the `-b` option of k5start and krenew.

      To Thomas Kula, for pointing out that `k_hasafs` has to be called before
      `k_setpag` when using the kafs functions.

      To Thomas Weiss, for noticing that code restructuring caused the
      argument to `-H` to be ignored in k5start and that `-H` and `-K` should
      be diagnosed as mutually exclusive.

      To Howard Wilkinson, for the initial version of the `-o`, `-g`, and `-m`
      support and further debugging of it.

      To Sascha Tandel, for the initial version of `-c` support and reports of
      build problems when the AFS libauthent and libafsrpc libraries didn't
      work.

      To Gautam Iyer, for the initial version of `-H` support in krenew.

      To Mike Horansky, for the idea of copying the current ticket cache when
      running krenew with a command, thereby saving the ticket cache from
      destruction when the user logs out.
